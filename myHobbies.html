	"ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I ENJOY DOING WITH MY FREE TIME IS TAKING PHOTOS. I AM BY NO MEANS A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER BUT THE PHOTOS I DO TAKE ARE FAR FROM BAD. THE FIRST TIME I WAS EXPOSED TO TAKING PHOTOS WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA WAS BACK IN THE SPRING OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. MY STEPDAD HAD GOT MY MOM A CAMERA FOR A VACATION TRIP TO HAWAII TO TAKE FAMILY PHOTOS. THOUGH THE CAMERA'S PURPOSE WAS FOR "FAMILY PHOTOS", WHENEVER THE CAMERA WASN'T BEING USED TO TAKE  I WAS GOING AROUND SNAPPING PICTURES OF WILDLFIE, BUILDINGS,A ND PEOPLE. AS FOR TODAY, I TAKE WHENEVER I FEEL THE URGE TO TAKE PHOTOS I JUST GRAB MY CAMERA AND GO OUT A SHOOT."

"I LOVE ME A GOOD CUP OF COFFEE. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SPRING OF MY FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE I HAD SEEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DRINKING COFFEE. BEFORE, MY PERCEPTION OF COFFEE WAS THAT IT WAS A BITTER BEVERAGE THAT OLD PEOPLE DRANK WITH THEIR BREAKFAST. LATER, A FRIEND BY THE NAME OF LUKE MILLER CHANGED HOW I PRECIVED COFFEE AND THOSE WHO DRANK IT. SINCE THEN I HAVE LEARNED TO APPRICIATE NOT ONLY COFFEE ITSELF BUT ALSO THE CRAFSMANSHIP/ART THAT COMES WITH MAKING IT"

"I BELIEVE THAT CHESS IS ONE THE BEST STRATIGICAL GAMES IN THE WORLD. WHEN I WAS A KID, MY DAD SAT ME DOWN A TAUGHT ME THE RULES OF CHESS. THIS MENTALLY DEMANDING GAME LATER BECAME THE "THE FATHER SON GAME" THAT SYMBOLIZED OUR RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, AFTER THE SEPARATION OF MY PARENTS I STOPPED PLAYING WITH MY DAD AND ONLY PLAYED OCCASIONALLY WITH FRIENDS. HOWEVER RECENTLY, ONE OF MY FRIENDS LANCE (BIG CHESS GUY) ACTUALLY GOT ME BACK INTO PLAYING IT. I AM IN NO WAY BETTER THAN HIM, BUT I ENJOY PLAYING CHESS WITH HIM."

"I OCCASIONALLY PLAY MY SAXOPHONE. BACK IN MIDDLE SCHOOL I DECIDED TO JOIN MY SCHOOL'S BAND AND THE INSTRUMENT I CHOSE TO PLAY WAS THE ALTO SAXOPHONE. I PLAYED ALL THROUGH MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. DURING MY YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL I PICKED UP THE SOPRANO SAXOPHONE AND TENOR SAXOPHONE, PLAYING FOR MY SCHOOL'S JAZZ BAND. PLAYING THE SAX HAD SUCH AN SIGNIFICANT IMAPCT ON MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITIES IT BROUGHT. I HAD THE CHANCE TO MARCH THE 2019 ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE IN IRELAND, PLAY FOR A PROSCHE EVENT ANNOUNING THE 2019 PORSCHE CARRERA, PERFORMING AT DISNEYLAND, AND MUCH MORE. TODAY, I RARELY TAKE MY SAXOHONE OUT TO PLAY BUT WHEN I DO I HAVE A GOOD TIME.

"I ENJOY WATCHING ANIME, MY 3 MOST FAVORITE ANIMES ARE SOUL EATER, DEMON SLAYER, AND NARUTO. THE FIRST ANIME I WATCHED WAS "SOUL EATER." THE SOUL EATER SERIES IS ONE OF THOSE LOWKEY ANIMES THAT NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT, BUT THE CONCEPT OF AN ACADEMY, CONSISTING OF WEAPONS AND MEISTERS, CREATED TO DEFEAT EVIL IS GREAT PLOT AND I WISH IT WAS MORE WELL KNOW. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ANIME IS DEMON SLAYER. DEMON SLAYER IS A GREAT FIRST ANIME FOR ANYONE WHO IS WANTING TO GET INTO IT. THEN WE HAVE NARUTO, THE MOST POPULAR ANIME. EVERYONE HAS SEEN OR AT LEAST HEAR OF NARUTO. ITS THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IN THE ANIME SECTION OF ANY STORE AND THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD "ANIME."

"I REALLY ENJOY LISTENINNG TO MUSIC, IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN LIFE THAT ENABLES US TO EXPERIENCE LIFE BEYOND THE FIVE PHISICAL SENSES. FOR ME MUSIC IS AN ESCAPE FROM MY HEAD (A THERAPY SESSION IF YOU WILL). I INTERNALIZE MY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS WHICH ISN'T GOOD, BUT WHEN I HAVE MUSIC, ALL OF MY FOCUS IS TOWARDS WHATEVER SONG I MAY BE LISTENING TO AND NOT MY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. AS FOR MY FAVORITE ARTIST, THAT WOULD BE NF. "
